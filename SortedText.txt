About whom does your lyre sigh?



"Drop, drop!" - there was a cry;
"My uncle of the most honest rules,
(And so I began my novel);
(Judges decisive and strict)
.
A cabman is pulling to the stock exchange,
A column rises blue,
A poem of twenty-five songs.
A small scientist, but a pedant:
A splendid house shines;
Adorable, dear friends!
Adriatic waves,
After the muse revived them:
Again her touch
Again longing, again love! ..
Again the imagination boils
Ah, legs, legs! where are you now?
Alas, for different fun
All than for a plentiful whim
All these words are not in Russian;
All this often gives
Along a sleepy street in rows
Along the freeway of the sea
Already awakened by the drum.
Although there are no streets, no palaces,
Always happy with myself
Amber on the pipes of Tsaregrad,
Among everyday pleasures?
Among the brilliant victories,
Amuse the half-dead
An eloquent madcap 6.
An invaluable reward
And I am very glad that the old way
And I couldn't think of a better one.
And I crave glory and praise
And I feel the leg in my hands;
And I see, I blame you,
And I will give a thoughtful outfit;
And I would be glad to say goodbye to him.
And Onegin went out;
And Petersburg is restless
And Strasbourg's imperishable pie
And a baker, a neat German,
And a sharp, chilled mind.
And abuse, and a saber, and lead.
And after her alone
And after importantly parted,
And again, devoted to idleness,
And along the Baltic waves
And already yawned in advance,
And among the midday swells,
And as a hero I will name;
And besides, they are so innocent.
And bowed at ease;
And brushes of thirty kinds
And calmed the torment of the heart,
And came out of the restroom
And drowned out by the roar of violins
And earn me glory tribute:
And far niente is my law.
And finally saw the light.
And finally screwed up.
And for a joke, with bile
And for delivering a letter.
And gave the land as a pledge.
And golden pineapple.
And he beats his leg with a quick leg.
And he did not get into the fervent shop
And he said: “It’s time for everyone to change;
And he took me for a walk in the Summer Garden.
And journalists to eat
And labor, and flour, and joy,
And ladies and fashionable eccentrics.
And leaning on granite
And make the ladies smile
And my Eugene left you.
And outdated old
And pour sharp words
And rainbows on the snow suggest;
And remember the past?
And she ran after him
And soon, soon the storm will follow
And suddenly a jump, and suddenly it flies,
And the anger of gloomy epigrams.
And the capricious Knyazhnin;
And the captives of the banks of the Salgir.
And the coachmen, around the lights,
And the dark mind cleared.
And the distrustful old man
And the girl of the mountains, my ideal,
And the land of fathers, and imprisonment?
And the majestic cuckold
And the old is delirious with novelty.
And the shelf, with their dusty family,
And the truth is that in our summer
And there he walks in the open,
And there was a deep economy,
And think about the beauty of nails:
And though he was an ardent rake,
And tightness, and brilliance, and joy,
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
And truffles, the luxury of youth,
And turning the morning at midnight
And waters cheerful glass
And we were captivated in the distance
And what lives, and why
And what we called a dandy.
And you, young beauties,
And, aiming at an alien light
And, feelings of pampered joy,
And, full of inspiration again,
And, having risen, the curtain rustles.
And, others, no one, by God!
Anger awaited both
Another slowly circles
Are you all the same? other le maidens,
As a tribute to the ready land.
As if they were doing business.
As if we can't
As in the meadows your light footprint.
As in the village boredom is the same
As soon as about himself.
Assign someone else's mind to yourself;
At first Madame followed him,
Attentive or indifferent!
Attracts by conditional beauty
Be proud and obedient
Beef-steaks and Strasbourg pie
Before him roast-beef bloodied,
Before the faded houses
Beneath it, the morning snow crunches.
Between Onegin and me
Between live Limburg cheese
Big loss in not seeing
Blessed is he who combined with her
Blind Fortune and people
Blow your nose, cough, hiss, clap;
Boiling my youth
Bored with your harness,
Born on the banks of the Neva
Bowed, then on stage
Branil Homer, Theocritus;
Brilliant, half-air,
But I don't want to fix them.
But I'm tired of Didlo too." 5.
But I, loving, was stupid and mute.
But full of praise for the haughty
But he fell out of love at last
But if morals had not suffered,
But in general their conversation
But in what he was a true genius,
But life has completely cooled off.
But my god, what a bore
But pantaloons, tailcoat, vest,
But read Adam Smith
But soon we were fate
But sweeter, in the midst of nightly fun,
But the days of the past are jokes
But the north is harmful for me 1.
But the sound of a breguet informs them,
But was my Eugene happy,
But you, blessed husbands,
But, exhausted by the noise of the ball
But, having arrived in the uncle's village,
By the beginning of life young.
By the proud lyre of Albion
By the sea on granite rocks.
By the will of Zeus
Careless and healthy?
Carry away the droshky
Catch a moment of tenderness
Caught and fame meanwhile;
Changed to something.
Chase love, and suddenly
Cherished in eastern bliss,
Climbing up the marble steps
Close to unfinished verses
Combs, steel files,
Confused me; but I'm used to
Corneille is a majestic genius;
Could not understand how important Grim
Could speak and write;
Crooked talk, noise and abuse!
Custom despot among people.
Deceptive ... like their legs.
Defender of Liberty and Rights
Describe my case:
Desires masterful swarm.
Diana's chest, Flora's cheeks
Did you dedicate a chant to her?
Didn't want to try
Disappointed lorgnette,
Divorced for a long time.
Does not reflect the face of Diana,
Doorman past he's an arrow
Dotted with bowls all around,
Double carriage lights
Double lorgnette slanting induces
Draped with mourning taffeta.
Dreams involuntary devotion
Dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Easily danced the mazurka
Enemies and friends gathered
Entered: and a cork in the ceiling,
Eugene immediately on a date
Eugene, hating litigation,
Even though I looked in the old days
Everyone has their own mind and sense:
Everything decorated the office
Everything in Paris tastes hungry,
Everything is clapping. Onegin enters,
Everything that Eugene knew,
Everything was quiet; only night
Expect involuntary affection
Factories, waters, forests, lands
Familiar faces on a boring stage
Far away from Italy.
Father could not understand him
Fearing jealous judgments
Fields! I am devoted to you in soul.
Fiery eyes fly
First Onegin's language
Fix his pillows
Flashing head profiles
Floated on a dormant river:
Floating in a mysterious gondola;
Flowers, love, village, idleness,
Flying in the dust on postage,
Foblas is an old student,
Fonvizin shone, friend of freedom,
Fool, will you forget them?
For both nails and teeth.
For luxury, for fashionable bliss, -
For rural silence;
For sweet bliss and freedom:
For the forest and fat carries us,
For the sounds of life do not spare,
Freaks of the big world!
Free, again looking for an alliance
Free, in the color of the best years,
French cuisine best color,
Friends and friendship are tired,
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
From Romulus to the present day
From the manager's report,
Frost dust silver
Fun and luxury child.
Fun indifferent spectator,
Funeral hunters.
Gathered before Onegin
Gave three balls annually
Genesis of the earth:
Get a secret date...
Getting ready for the money
Give lessons in silence!
Go to the Neva shores
Golden nights of Italy
Great charm of conversation.
Has entered. The hall is full of people;
Haven't stopped stomping yet
Having chosen a useful trade,
He appeared in drawing rooms;
He could not iambic from a chorea,
He did not notice anything.
He doesn't need gold
He forced himself to respect
He found the yard full of services;
He goes home to get dressed.
He had a lucky talent
He had no desire to rummage
He is familiar to me, he is dear to me.
He is holy to the grandchildren of Apollo;
He is terribly dissatisfied;
He kept it in his memory.
He knew enough Latin
He left you all before;
He rewarded with touching affection
He rushed to Talon 4: he is sure
He sat down - with a laudable purpose
He set up a shelf with a detachment of books,
He shone with an obedient tear!
He shoot himself, thank God,
He used to be in bed:
He was caressed by the crafty husband,
He was no longer interested;
He was sick; nothing
He was tired of the light noise;
He's completely French
Hear my sad voice:
Hear your magical voice!
Hearts of note coquettes!
Heir of all his relatives.
Here describe his attire;
Here is my Onegin at large;
Here is our Onegin - a villager,
Here our hero drove up to the entrance;
Him his rivals,
His beaver collar.
His example to others is science;
His father lived in debt
His father then died.
His melancholy laziness, -
Hold hope, be jealous
Honorary citizen backstage,
How I envied the waves
How I wished then with the waves
How careless in heartfelt letters!
How could he be new?
How could he forget himself!
How dandy 2 London is dressed -
How does the state grow rich?
How early could he be hypocritical,
How early could he disturb
How eloquently eloquent
How he, lagging behind the hustle and bustle,
How languidly he was silent,
How long have I forgotten for you
How often in the summer
How piit 9 described himself.
How swift and gentle his gaze was,
How vehemently he cursed!
However, Terpsichore's leg
I ask you to notice my speech:
I became friends with him at that time.
I could before the learned light
I could dazzle much less
I dared to clean my nails in front of him,
I did not bother with strict morality,
I did not repeat later shamelessly,
I did not want with such torment
I do not catch flying glory.
I dreamed and my soul
I endured ballets for a long time,
I finished the first chapter;
I found it on the table
I hate the elements
I have already opened my vasisdas.
I have experienced it remorselessly.
I hold a happy stirrup...
I liked his features
I looked at all the tiers,
I looked in great confusion,
I lost a lot of life!
I love crazy youth
I love her, my friend Elvina,
I love their legs; only hardly
I note by the way: all poets -
I often hear the question:
I once walked there too:
I read and read, but to no avail:
I read little, I sleep a lot,
I remember another time!
I remember the sea before the storm:
I remember them all, and in a dream
I saw everything: faces, headwear
I shared with the young Semyonova;
I straightened my hair with my hand,
I wake up every morning
I want to warn you.
I wanted to write - but hard work
I was already thinking about the shape of the plan
I was born for a peaceful life
I was crazy about balls:
I was embittered, he is sullen;
I will enjoy the bliss in the wild,
I will give the fruits of my labors:
I will offer you my services;
I will pay my debt to censorship
I woke up in the morning with a pleasant noise.
I would still love balls.
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
I'm always glad to see the difference
I'm sad; but there are no more tears

Ignite the blood in the withered heart,
Ile foretelling from afar
Ile percy, full of languor;
Illness whose cause
In Moldova, in the wilderness of the steppes,
In a paper cap, more than once
In bed from the ball he rides:
In both hearts the heat died down;
In cherished dreams sometimes
In chronological dust
In foreign words,
In heaven they splash impatiently,
In my soul it will completely subside:
In short: Russian melancholy
In that conscience, in that there is no sense;
In the Academic Dictionary.
In the days of fun and desires
In the last taste of the toilet
In the soul do not despise people;
In the spring on the ants of the meadows,
In the very morning of our days.
In the wilderness, the lyrical voice is louder,
In their captivating footsteps
In this case, it's completely wrong.
In winter, on a cast-iron fireplace,
Inimitable strangeness
Innocent years of prejudice
Interprets Sey and Bentham,
Intricate slander
Inventing for fun
Isn't it me in the old days
It flies like fluff from the mouth of Eol;
It is no wonder to be in time everywhere.
It's already dark: he sits in the sled.
It's easy for us to shine.
It's high time to find
It's three hours at least
It's time for Eugene
It's time for hope and tender sadness,
It's time to leave the boring beach
It's time, it's time! - I call to her;
Jealous whisper of fashionable wives.
Joking innocence to amaze
Just to be heard).
Keep silent in an important dispute
Keep your lorgnette straight!

Lanterns are shining everywhere;
Latin is out of fashion now:
Leisure devotion to the innocent,
Lenders greedy regiment.
Let me introduce you:
Lie down at her feet with love!
Like Byron, poet of pride,
Like Child-Harold, sullen, languid
Like a green forest from prison
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
Like an English spin
Like windy Venus
Like women, he left books
Listen to the first sound of the heart
Live creative dreams.
Look after your daughters:
Loop and noise and tightness;
Love crazy anxiety
Love dreamy friends.
Lunch will not ring for him.
Luxurious touch.
Magic edge! there in the old days,
Magic sounds, feelings and thoughts;
Manyu sails ships.
Matching here my features,
Merry pour out light
Mind and passion to win,
Monotonous and variegated.
Monsieur l'Abbé, poor Frenchman,
Monsieur was driven out of the yard.
More cupids, devils, snakes
More glasses of thirst asks
More tired lackeys
My Onegin has already galloped.
My goddesses! what do you? Where are you?
My happiest days?
My young days flew by.
Neither a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
Neither the gossip of the world, nor Boston,
Night sky over Neva 8
No cards, no balls, no poetry.
No compulsion to speak
No high passion
No matter how we fought, to distinguish.
No songs inspired by them:
No women's legs, no heads;
No, never a rush of passion
No, never in hot days
No: early feelings in him cooled down;
Noisy swarm of their comedies,
Not leaving a single step away!
Not that...not that, God forbid!
Notconstant admirer
Nothing touched him
Now from you my friends
Now talkative, then dumb,
Now the camp will soviet, then it will develop
O you venerable spouses!
Of course it would be bold
Oh Brent! no, I see you
Oh! for a long time I could not forget
On all different chains;
On sighs, boredom and deceit
On the lodges of unfamiliar ladies;
On the mirror parquet hall,
On the northern, sad snow
On the third grove, hill and field
One breathing, one loving,
One foot touching the floor
Onegin flew to the theater
Onegin goes to the boulevard
Onegin locked himself at home,
Onegin was in the opinion of many
Onegin was ready with me
Onegin, my good friend,
Only a boat, waving oars,
Or a dull look will not find
Or any publisher
Or roses of fiery cheeks,
Or shone, my reader;
Parterre and chairs - everything is in full swing;
Passed love, the muse appeared,
People I don't judge
People's tears, applause
Perfume in cut crystal;
Petersburg bridge,
Petrarch walking after
Philosopher at the age of eighteen.
Poetry sacred nonsense,
Porcelain and bronze on the table
Pour hot fat cutlets,
Pouring champagne in a bottle
Pray and demand recognition
Prettier than something for me.
Priests and guests ate and drank
Put vale at the end of the letter
Reading the sad message
Ready to slam entrechat,
Remembering past years novels,
Remembering the old love
Renegade of violent pleasures,
Replacing, did not replace you?
Retell me lack of time;
Revisited it all rigorously:
Rousseau (notice in passing)
Running in a stormy line
Rushed through the mail
Sad to give medicine
Satisfied with his lot,
Satyrs are a bold ruler,
Scold the gentlemen and beat in the palm -
See foreign countries;
Sensitive, careless again
Serving excellently nobly,
Shadows walk through solid windows,
Shameful and impudent, and sometimes
Shaved in the latest fashion
She kept their secret image;
She took possession of him little by little;
She, prophesying the look
Sheath Phaedra, Cleopatra,
Sigh about gloomy Russia,
Sigh and think to yourself:
Silently I will yawn
Sleeps peacefully in the shadow of the blissful
Slightly scolded for pranks
So I, careless, chanted
So careful, so precise
So did not torment my soul!
So education, thank God,
So full of piety
So impregnable for men
So majestic, so smart
So that the child is not exhausted,
So thought the young rake,
So we were carried away by a dream
So, if you tell the truth,
Something and somehow
Soul filled flight?
Spent in front of the mirrors
Spent in inaction, in the shadows
Still outside and inside
Still, vegetating, the horses are fighting,
Straight scissors, curved
Suddenly got it really
Surrounded by a crowd of nymphs
Taking your curious gaze,
Talk about Juvenal
Taught him everything jokingly
That I have not sinned for a long time.
That I smeared my portrait,
That a new ballet has begun.
That he is smart and very nice.
That is, he was able to judge
That repentance gnaws.
That serpent of memories
That the sight of them already gives birth to spleen 7.
That uncle is dying in bed
That's why I'm writing this
The beauties didn't last long
The blues was waiting for him on guard,
The chant of Torquat octaves!
The child was sharp, but sweet.
The conditions of light overthrowing the burden,
The coolness of the gloomy oak,
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
The death of the old uncle.
The deceased was buried.
The extinguished ashes will no longer flare up,
The fate of Eugene kept:
The fault of the comet spurted current;
The fever of rhymes: he doubled that
The fire of unexpected epigrams.
The ghost of the irretrievable days:
The goddess is going to the masquerade.
The happiness of youth is gone
The higher tone is rather boring;
The horn and the song are remote ...
The language of Petrarch and love.
The legs of lovely ladies are flying;
The life tormented both of us;
The merchant gets up, the peddler goes,
The murmur of a quiet stream;
The music is already tired of thundering;
The okhtenka is in a hurry with a jug,
The order of the enemy and the waster,
The owner is complete, but hitherto
The pen, forgetting, does not draw,
The second Chadaev, my Eugene,
The sentries called to one another,
The shutters are open; pipe smoke
The sleepy convict has been moved,
The spurs of the cavalry guard jingle;
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
The theater is already full; lodges shine;
The theater is an evil legislator,
The words and gaze of these sorceresses
Then I'll start writing
Then Monsieur replaced her.
Then he saw clearly
Then they would induce sleep;
Then, that I belong to them.
Then, which could not always
There Didlo was crowned with glory,
There Ozerov involuntary tribute
There are a lot of contradictions
There are no more charms
There he brought out the sharp Shakhovskoy
There is boredom, there is deceit or delirium;
There is no place for confessions
There our Katenin resurrected
There was a pedant in his clothes
There was a science of tender passion,
There will be a ball, there is a children's party.
There, there under the shadow of the wings
They are not worth the passion
They carry notes to him.
They jump and make noise on the stage;
They sleep on fur coats at the entrance;
They trouble my heart.
Though maybe a different lady
Three houses for the evening call:
Three pairs of slender female legs
To amuse with pleasant flattery,
To frighten with despair ready,
To his caustic argument,
To kiss the lips of the young Armides,
To parse epigraphs,
To seem gloomy, to languish,
To the dead from all sides
To the mocking reader
To whom, in the crowd of jealous maidens,
Touch cute feet with your mouth!
Touch everything lightly
Trades London scrupulous
Treason managed to tire;
Turned away - and yawned,
Two days seemed new to him
Two legs ... Sad, cold,
Two verses from the Aeneid.
Unbearable, though innocent nonsense;
Under the long tablecloth
Under the robe of storms, arguing with the waves,
Under the sky of my Africa 11,
Until the dormant breguet
Until the morning his life is ready,
Used to be cute things

Wakes up at noon, and again
Walks between the chairs on the legs,
Wandering over the desert lake
Wandering over the sea 10, waiting for the weather,
Was he really among the feasts
We all learned a little
We both knew the passion game;
We now have something wrong in the subject:
We silently drank!
We'd better hurry to the ball
Wearing a wide bolivar 3,
What about my Onegin? half asleep
What do you want more? The world decided
What he knew more firmly than all sciences,
What is Kaverin waiting for him there.
What is it my poor syllable
What low deceit
What nets he prepared for them!
What took all day
What was madness for him
What? Invitations? Indeed,
When I fell ill in earnest,
When a simple product has.
When and where, in what desert,
When did you want to destroy
When the head hurt;
When transparent and light
When will I start freestyle running?
When will the devil take you!
When will the rebellious youth
When, wearing a man's outfit,
Where I buried my heart.
Where I suffered, where I loved
Where do you crumple spring flowers?
Where everyone, breathing freely,
Where headlong in a pit carriage
Where is the mod pupil exemplary
Where might you have been born?
Where will my prankster go?
Which Nazon sang,
Which later sometimes
While in the morning dress,
While my romance
Who felt, that worries
Who lived and thought, he cannot
Who will he start with? Does not matter:
Whom did your verse idolize?
Whose gaze, exciting inspiration,
Why did he end up a sufferer
Why fruitlessly argue with the century?
Will I hear your choruses again?
Will I portray in a true picture
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
Will the hour of my freedom come?
With Millionne it suddenly resounded;
With a heart full of regrets
With a learned air of a connoisseur
With a young Venetian
With her my mouth will find
With his chatty lyre;
With men from all sides
With my dinner and my wife.
With the breath of a supportive night
With the hero of my novel
With the sick to sit day and night,
Without preamble, this very hour
Worth Istomin; she is,
Write poems about others
