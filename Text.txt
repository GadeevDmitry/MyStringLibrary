"My uncle of the most honest rules,
When I fell ill in earnest,
He forced himself to respect
And I couldn't think of a better one.
His example to others is science;
But my god, what a bore
With the sick to sit day and night,
Not leaving a single step away!
What low deceit
Amuse the half-dead
Fix his pillows
Sad to give medicine
Sigh and think to yourself:
When will the devil take you!
II
So thought the young rake,
Flying in the dust on postage,
By the will of Zeus
Heir of all his relatives.
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
With the hero of my novel
Without preamble, this very hour
Let me introduce you:
Onegin, my good friend,
Born on the banks of the Neva
Where might you have been born?
Or shone, my reader;
I once walked there too:
But the north is harmful for me 1.
III
Serving excellently nobly,
His father lived in debt
Gave three balls annually
And finally screwed up.
The fate of Eugene kept:
At first Madame followed him,
Then Monsieur replaced her.
The child was sharp, but sweet.
Monsieur l'Abbé, poor Frenchman,
So that the child is not exhausted,
Taught him everything jokingly
I did not bother with strict morality,
Slightly scolded for pranks
And he took me for a walk in the Summer Garden.
IV
When will the rebellious youth
It's time for Eugene
It's time for hope and tender sadness,
Monsieur was driven out of the yard.
Here is my Onegin at large;
Shaved in the latest fashion
How dandy 2 London is dressed -
And finally saw the light.
He's completely French
Could speak and write;
Easily danced the mazurka
And bowed at ease;
What do you want more? The world decided
That he is smart and very nice.
V
We all learned a little
Something and somehow
So education, thank God,
It's easy for us to shine.
Onegin was in the opinion of many
(Judges decisive and strict)
A small scientist, but a pedant:
He had a lucky talent
No compulsion to speak
Touch everything lightly
With a learned air of a connoisseur
Keep silent in an important dispute
And make the ladies smile
The fire of unexpected epigrams.
VI
Latin is out of fashion now:
So, if you tell the truth,
He knew enough Latin
To parse epigraphs,
Talk about Juvenal
Put vale at the end of the letter
Yes, I remember, though not without sin,
Two verses from the Aeneid.
He had no desire to rummage
In chronological dust
Genesis of the earth:
But the days of the past are jokes
From Romulus to the present day
He kept it in his memory.
VII
No high passion
For the sounds of life do not spare,
He could not iambic from a chorea,
No matter how we fought, to distinguish.
Branil Homer, Theocritus;
But read Adam Smith
And there was a deep economy,
That is, he was able to judge
How does the state grow rich?
And what lives, and why
He doesn't need gold
When a simple product has.
Father could not understand him
And gave the land as a pledge.
VIII
Everything that Eugene knew,
Retell me lack of time;
But in what he was a true genius,
What he knew more firmly than all sciences,
What was madness for him
And labor, and flour, and joy,
What took all day
His melancholy laziness, -
There was a science of tender passion,
Which Nazon sang,
Why did he end up a sufferer
Your age is brilliant and rebellious
In Moldova, in the wilderness of the steppes,
Far away from Italy.
IX

X
How early could he be hypocritical,
Hold hope, be jealous
disbelieve, make believe
To seem gloomy, to languish,
Be proud and obedient
Attentive or indifferent!
How languidly he was silent,
How eloquently eloquent
How careless in heartfelt letters!
One breathing, one loving,
How could he forget himself!
How swift and gentle his gaze was,
Shameful and impudent, and sometimes
He shone with an obedient tear!
XI
How could he be new?
Joking innocence to amaze
To frighten with despair ready,
To amuse with pleasant flattery,
Catch a moment of tenderness
Innocent years of prejudice
Mind and passion to win,
Expect involuntary affection
Pray and demand recognition
Listen to the first sound of the heart
Chase love, and suddenly
Get a secret date...
And after her alone
Give lessons in silence!
XII
How early could he disturb
Hearts of note coquettes!
When did you want to destroy
Him his rivals,
How vehemently he cursed!
What nets he prepared for them!
But you, blessed husbands,
You were friends with him:
He was caressed by the crafty husband,
Foblas is an old student,
And the distrustful old man
And the majestic cuckold
Always happy with myself
With my dinner and my wife.
XIII. XIV

XV
He used to be in bed:
They carry notes to him.
What? Invitations? Indeed,
Three houses for the evening call:
There will be a ball, there is a children's party.
Where will my prankster go?
Who will he start with? Does not matter:
It is no wonder to be in time everywhere.
While in the morning dress,
Wearing a wide bolivar 3,
Onegin goes to the boulevard
And there he walks in the open,
Until the dormant breguet
Lunch will not ring for him.
XVI
It's already dark: he sits in the sled.
"Drop, drop!" - there was a cry;
Frost dust silver
His beaver collar.
He rushed to Talon 4: he is sure
What is Kaverin waiting for him there.
Entered: and a cork in the ceiling,
The fault of the comet spurted current;
Before him roast-beef bloodied,
And truffles, the luxury of youth,
French cuisine best color,
And Strasbourg's imperishable pie
Between live Limburg cheese
And golden pineapple.
XVII
More glasses of thirst asks
Pour hot fat cutlets,
But the sound of a breguet informs them,
That a new ballet has begun.
The theater is an evil legislator,
Notconstant admirer
charming actresses,
Honorary citizen backstage,
Onegin flew to the theater
Where everyone, breathing freely,
Ready to slam entrechat,
Sheath Phaedra, Cleopatra,
call Moina (in order
Just to be heard).
XVIII
Magic edge! there in the old days,
Satyrs are a bold ruler,
Fonvizin shone, friend of freedom,
And the capricious Knyazhnin;
There Ozerov involuntary tribute
People's tears, applause
I shared with the young Semyonova;
There our Katenin resurrected
Corneille is a majestic genius;
There he brought out the sharp Shakhovskoy
Noisy swarm of their comedies,
There Didlo was crowned with glory,
There, there under the shadow of the wings
My young days flew by.
XIX
My goddesses! what do you? Where are you?
Hear my sad voice:
Are you all the same? other le maidens,
Replacing, did not replace you?
Will I hear your choruses again?
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
Soul filled flight?
Or a dull look will not find
Familiar faces on a boring stage
And, aiming at an alien light
Disappointed lorgnette,
Fun indifferent spectator,
Silently I will yawn
And remember the past?
XX
The theater is already full; lodges shine;
Parterre and chairs - everything is in full swing;
In heaven they splash impatiently,
And, having risen, the curtain rustles.
Brilliant, half-air,
obedient to the magic bow,
Surrounded by a crowd of nymphs
Worth Istomin; she is,
One foot touching the floor
Another slowly circles
And suddenly a jump, and suddenly it flies,
It flies like fluff from the mouth of Eol;
Now the camp will soviet, then it will develop
And he beats his leg with a quick leg.
XXI
Everything is clapping. Onegin enters,
Walks between the chairs on the legs,
Double lorgnette slanting induces
On the lodges of unfamiliar ladies;
I looked at all the tiers,
I saw everything: faces, headwear
He is terribly dissatisfied;
With men from all sides
Bowed, then on stage
I looked in great confusion,
Turned away - and yawned,
And he said: “It’s time for everyone to change;
I endured ballets for a long time,
But I'm tired of Didlo too." 5.
XXII
More cupids, devils, snakes
They jump and make noise on the stage;
More tired lackeys
They sleep on fur coats at the entrance;
Haven't stopped stomping yet
Blow your nose, cough, hiss, clap;
Still outside and inside
Lanterns are shining everywhere;
Still, vegetating, the horses are fighting,
Bored with your harness,
And the coachmen, around the lights,
Scold the gentlemen and beat in the palm -
And Onegin went out;
He goes home to get dressed.
XXIII
Will I portray in a true picture
secluded office,
Where is the mod pupil exemplary
Dressed, undressed and dressed again?
All than for a plentiful whim
Trades London scrupulous
And along the Baltic waves
For the forest and fat carries us,
Everything in Paris tastes hungry,
Having chosen a useful trade,
Inventing for fun
For luxury, for fashionable bliss, -
Everything decorated the office
Philosopher at the age of eighteen.
XXIV
Amber on the pipes of Tsaregrad,
Porcelain and bronze on the table
And, feelings of pampered joy,
Perfume in cut crystal;
Combs, steel files,
Straight scissors, curved
And brushes of thirty kinds
For both nails and teeth.
Rousseau (notice in passing)
Could not understand how important Grim
I dared to clean my nails in front of him,
An eloquent madcap 6.
Defender of Liberty and Rights
In this case, it's completely wrong.
XXV
You can be a good person
And think about the beauty of nails:
Why fruitlessly argue with the century?
Custom despot among people.
The second Chadaev, my Eugene,
Fearing jealous judgments
There was a pedant in his clothes
And what we called a dandy.
It's three hours at least
Spent in front of the mirrors
And came out of the restroom
Like windy Venus
When, wearing a man's outfit,
The goddess is going to the masquerade.
XXVI
In the last taste of the toilet
Taking your curious gaze,
I could before the learned light
Here describe his attire;
Of course it would be bold
Describe my case:
But pantaloons, tailcoat, vest,
All these words are not in Russian;
And I see, I blame you,
What is it my poor syllable
I could dazzle much less
In foreign words,
Even though I looked in the old days
In the Academic Dictionary.
XXVII
We now have something wrong in the subject:
We'd better hurry to the ball
Where headlong in a pit carriage
My Onegin has already galloped.
Before the faded houses
Along a sleepy street in rows
Double carriage lights
Merry pour out light
And rainbows on the snow suggest;
Dotted with bowls all around,
A splendid house shines;
Shadows walk through solid windows,
Flashing head profiles
And ladies and fashionable eccentrics.
XXVIII
Here our hero drove up to the entrance;
Doorman past he's an arrow
Climbing up the marble steps
I straightened my hair with my hand,
Has entered. The hall is full of people;
The music is already tired of thundering;
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
Loop and noise and tightness;
The spurs of the cavalry guard jingle;
The legs of lovely ladies are flying;
In their captivating footsteps
Fiery eyes fly
And drowned out by the roar of violins
Jealous whisper of fashionable wives.
XXIX
In the days of fun and desires
I was crazy about balls:
There is no place for confessions
And for delivering a letter.
O you venerable spouses!
I will offer you my services;
I ask you to notice my speech:
I want to warn you.
You also, mothers, are stricter
Look after your daughters:
Keep your lorgnette straight!
Not that...not that, God forbid!
That's why I'm writing this
That I have not sinned for a long time.
XXX
Alas, for different fun
I lost a lot of life!
But if morals had not suffered,
I would still love balls.
I love crazy youth
And tightness, and brilliance, and joy,
And I will give a thoughtful outfit;
I love their legs; only hardly
You will find in Russia a whole
Three pairs of slender female legs
.
Oh! for a long time I could not forget
Two legs ... Sad, cold,
I remember them all, and in a dream
They trouble my heart.
XXXI
When and where, in what desert,
Fool, will you forget them?
Ah, legs, legs! where are you now?
Where do you crumple spring flowers?
Cherished in eastern bliss,
On the northern, sad snow
You left no trace
You loved soft carpets
Luxurious touch.
How long have I forgotten for you
And I crave glory and praise
And the land of fathers, and imprisonment?
The happiness of youth is gone
As in the meadows your light footprint.
XXXII
Diana's chest, Flora's cheeks
Adorable, dear friends!
However, Terpsichore's leg
Prettier than something for me.
She, prophesying the look
An invaluable reward
Attracts by conditional beauty
Desires masterful swarm.
I love her, my friend Elvina,
Under the long tablecloth
In the spring on the ants of the meadows,
In winter, on a cast-iron fireplace,
On the mirror parquet hall,
By the sea on granite rocks.
XXXIII
I remember the sea before the storm:
How I envied the waves
Running in a stormy line
Lie down at her feet with love!
How I wished then with the waves
Touch cute feet with your mouth!
No, never in hot days
Boiling my youth
I did not want with such torment
To kiss the lips of the young Armides,
Or roses of fiery cheeks,
Ile percy, full of languor;
No, never a rush of passion
So did not torment my soul!
XXXIV
I remember another time!
In cherished dreams sometimes
I hold a happy stirrup...
And I feel the leg in my hands;
Again the imagination boils
Again her touch
Ignite the blood in the withered heart,
Again longing, again love! ..
But full of praise for the haughty
With his chatty lyre;
They are not worth the passion
No songs inspired by them:
The words and gaze of these sorceresses
Deceptive ... like their legs.
XXXV
What about my Onegin? half asleep
In bed from the ball he rides:
And Petersburg is restless
Already awakened by the drum.
The merchant gets up, the peddler goes,
A cabman is pulling to the stock exchange,
The okhtenka is in a hurry with a jug,
Beneath it, the morning snow crunches.
I woke up in the morning with a pleasant noise.
The shutters are open; pipe smoke
A column rises blue,
And a baker, a neat German,
In a paper cap, more than once
I have already opened my vasisdas.
XXXVI
But, exhausted by the noise of the ball
And turning the morning at midnight
Sleeps peacefully in the shadow of the blissful
Fun and luxury child.
Wakes up at noon, and again
Until the morning his life is ready,
Monotonous and variegated.
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
But was my Eugene happy,
Free, in the color of the best years,
Among the brilliant victories,
Among everyday pleasures?
Was he really among the feasts
Careless and healthy?
XXXVII
No: early feelings in him cooled down;
He was tired of the light noise;
The beauties didn't last long
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
Treason managed to tire;
Friends and friendship are tired,
Then, which could not always
Beef-steaks and Strasbourg pie
Pouring champagne in a bottle
And pour sharp words
When the head hurt;
And though he was an ardent rake,
But he fell out of love at last
And abuse, and a saber, and lead.
XXXVIII
Illness whose cause
It's high time to find
Like an English spin
In short: Russian melancholy
She took possession of him little by little;
He shoot himself, thank God,
Didn't want to try
But life has completely cooled off.
Like Child-Harold, sullen, languid
He appeared in drawing rooms;
Neither the gossip of the world, nor Boston,
Neither a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
Nothing touched him
He did not notice anything.
XXXIX. XL. XLI

XLII
Freaks of the big world!
He left you all before;
And the truth is that in our summer
The higher tone is rather boring;
Though maybe a different lady
Interprets Sey and Bentham,
But in general their conversation
Unbearable, though innocent nonsense;
And besides, they are so innocent.
So majestic, so smart
So full of piety
So careful, so precise
So impregnable for men
That the sight of them already gives birth to spleen 7.
XLIII
And you, young beauties,
Which later sometimes
Carry away the droshky
Petersburg bridge,
And my Eugene left you.
Renegade of violent pleasures,
Onegin locked himself at home,
Yawning, took up the pen,
I wanted to write - but hard work
He was sick; nothing
did not come out of his pen,
And he did not get into the fervent shop
People I don't judge
Then, that I belong to them.
XLIV
And again, devoted to idleness,
languishing in spiritual emptiness,
He sat down - with a laudable purpose
Assign someone else's mind to yourself;
He set up a shelf with a detachment of books,
I read and read, but to no avail:
There is boredom, there is deceit or delirium;
In that conscience, in that there is no sense;
On all different chains;
And outdated old
And the old is delirious with novelty.
Like women, he left books
And the shelf, with their dusty family,
Draped with mourning taffeta.
XLV
The conditions of light overthrowing the burden,
How he, lagging behind the hustle and bustle,
I became friends with him at that time.
I liked his features
Dreams involuntary devotion
Inimitable strangeness
And a sharp, chilled mind.
I was embittered, he is sullen;
We both knew the passion game;
The life tormented both of us;
In both hearts the heat died down;
Anger awaited both
Blind Fortune and people
In the very morning of our days.
XLVI
Who lived and thought, he cannot
In the soul do not despise people;
Who felt, that worries
The ghost of the irretrievable days:
There are no more charms
That serpent of memories
That repentance gnaws.
All this often gives
Great charm of conversation.
First Onegin's language
Confused me; but I'm used to
To his caustic argument,
And for a joke, with bile
ew in half,
And the anger of gloomy epigrams.
XLVII
How often in the summer
When transparent and light
Night sky over Neva 8
And waters cheerful glass
Does not reflect the face of Diana,
Remembering past years novels,
Remembering the old love
Sensitive, careless again
With the breath of a supportive night
We silently drank!
Like a green forest from prison
The sleepy convict has been moved,
So we were carried away by a dream
By the beginning of life young.
XLVIII
With a heart full of regrets
And leaning on granite
Yevgeny stood thoughtfully,
How piit 9 described himself.
Everything was quiet; only night
The sentries called to one another,
Yes, a distant knock
With Millionne it suddenly resounded;
Only a boat, waving oars,
Floated on a dormant river:
And we were captivated in the distance
The horn and the song are remote ...
But sweeter, in the midst of nightly fun,
The chant of Torquat octaves!
XLIX
Adriatic waves,
Oh Brent! no, I see you
And, full of inspiration again,
Hear your magical voice!
He is holy to the grandchildren of Apollo;
By the proud lyre of Albion
He is familiar to me, he is dear to me.
Golden nights of Italy
I will enjoy the bliss in the wild,
With a young Venetian
Now talkative, then dumb,
Floating in a mysterious gondola;
With her my mouth will find
The language of Petrarch and love.
L
Will the hour of my freedom come?
It's time, it's time! - I call to her;
Wandering over the sea 10, waiting for the weather,
Manyu sails ships.
Under the robe of storms, arguing with the waves,
Along the freeway of the sea
When will I start freestyle running?
It's time to leave the boring beach
I hate the elements
And among the midday swells,
Under the sky of my Africa 11,
Sigh about gloomy Russia,
Where I suffered, where I loved
Where I buried my heart.
LI
Onegin was ready with me
See foreign countries;
But soon we were fate
Divorced for a long time.
His father then died.
Gathered before Onegin
Lenders greedy regiment.
Everyone has their own mind and sense:
Eugene, hating litigation,
Satisfied with his lot,
gave them an inheritance,
Big loss in not seeing
Ile foretelling from afar
The death of the old uncle.
LII
Suddenly got it really
From the manager's report,
That uncle is dying in bed
And I would be glad to say goodbye to him.
Reading the sad message
Eugene immediately on a date
Rushed through the mail
And already yawned in advance,
Getting ready for the money
On sighs, boredom and deceit
(And so I began my novel);
But, having arrived in the uncle's village,
I found it on the table
As a tribute to the ready land.
LIII
He found the yard full of services;
To the dead from all sides
Enemies and friends gathered
Funeral hunters.
The deceased was buried.
Priests and guests ate and drank
And after importantly parted,
As if they were doing business.
Here is our Onegin - a villager,
Factories, waters, forests, lands
The owner is complete, but hitherto
The order of the enemy and the waster,
And I am very glad that the old way
Changed to something.
LIV
Two days seemed new to him
solitary fields,
The coolness of the gloomy oak,
The murmur of a quiet stream;
On the third grove, hill and field
He was no longer interested;
Then they would induce sleep;
Then he saw clearly
As in the village boredom is the same
Although there are no streets, no palaces,
No cards, no balls, no poetry.
The blues was waiting for him on guard,
And she ran after him
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
LV
I was born for a peaceful life
For rural silence;
In the wilderness, the lyrical voice is louder,
Live creative dreams.
Leisure devotion to the innocent,
Wandering over the desert lake
And far niente is my law.
I wake up every morning
For sweet bliss and freedom:
I read little, I sleep a lot,
I do not catch flying glory.
Isn't it me in the old days
Spent in inaction, in the shadows
My happiest days?
LVI
Flowers, love, village, idleness,
Fields! I am devoted to you in soul.
I'm always glad to see the difference
Between Onegin and me
To the mocking reader
Or any publisher
Intricate slander
Matching here my features,
I did not repeat later shamelessly,
That I smeared my portrait,
Like Byron, poet of pride,
As if we can't
Write poems about others
As soon as about himself.
LVII
I note by the way: all poets -
Love dreamy friends.
Used to be cute things
I dreamed and my soul
She kept their secret image;
After the muse revived them:
So I, careless, chanted
And the girl of the mountains, my ideal,
And the captives of the banks of the Salgir.
Now from you my friends
I often hear the question:
“About whom does your lyre sigh?
To whom, in the crowd of jealous maidens,
Did you dedicate a chant to her?
LVIII
Whose gaze, exciting inspiration,
He rewarded with touching affection
Your thoughtful singing?
Whom did your verse idolize?
And, others, no one, by God!
Love crazy anxiety
I have experienced it remorselessly.
Blessed is he who combined with her
The fever of rhymes: he doubled that
Poetry sacred nonsense,
Petrarch walking after
And calmed the torment of the heart,
Caught and fame meanwhile;
But I, loving, was stupid and mute.
LIX
Passed love, the muse appeared,
And the dark mind cleared.
Free, again looking for an alliance
Magic sounds, feelings and thoughts;
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
The pen, forgetting, does not draw,
Close to unfinished verses
No women's legs, no heads;
The extinguished ashes will no longer flare up,
I'm sad; but there are no more tears
And soon, soon the storm will follow
In my soul it will completely subside:
Then I'll start writing
A poem of twenty-five songs.
LX
I was already thinking about the shape of the plan
And as a hero I will name;
While my romance
I finished the first chapter;
Revisited it all rigorously:
There are a lot of contradictions
But I don't want to fix them.
y.
I will pay my debt to censorship
And journalists to eat
I will give the fruits of my labors:
Go to the Neva shores
newborn creation,
And earn me glory tribute:
Crooked talk, noise and abuse!
